          She is very prideful and has superiority complex as she wanted other people to address her as "Your Highness" or "Queen". Medusa has a soft point towards children and admitted that humans are interesting(Only In Manhua). She didn't have much respect for Human Life before Xiao Yan. She has the traits of a Medusa (A Name meaning Snake Queen, i.e. there were various Queen Medusa before her) which is a "Medusa truly loves someone until the end once she has been subdued by him."[5] Despite the fact that Xiao Yan has taken her virginity[6], she has conflicted feeling about killing him which she acknowledges.
